The content is refreshing and applicable from the SOC analyst to the seasoned cybersecurity leadership team. We all need to understand how our work connects to business value. The prescriptive approach and techniques revealed in the detailed MBA-style case studies offer insights that you will not find in any other cybersecurity book that exists. Congrats to Matt and Rock for helping bond cybersecurity to business in a more intimate way than ever before! Go buy this book.” <br>?Malcolm Harkins <br>Chief Security and Trust Officer Epiphany Systems; former CISO Intel and Cylance <br>“If you are a CISO or someone working to become one and want to uplevel your executive communications skills and truly gain insights into running security risks like business read this book. This is the first book that gives true examples that can help you actually see what others only talk about at the high level. Matt and Rock have done a great job sharing the intimate stories that have helped shape their great careers.” <br>Dave Hannigan <br>Director Product Security Assurance Google Cloud <br>“This is a book that our industry has needed for a long time. Security skills and a fundamental understanding of modern technology is important. One could argue that for a CISO it’s equally important ? perhaps even more important ? to understand how the business runs. To protect the value created by an organization we must understand how that value is created in the first place. Thank you Matthew and Rock. Every security leader can benefit by reading this book.”<br> ?Caroline Wong Chief Strategy Officer Cobalt.io <br>“Transitioning from cybersecurity operator to investor and board member has reinforced for me that success in the CISO role is only available to those that can blend technical expertise with business savvy. <br>The CISO Evolution<br> provides a timeless reference that combines predictive theories with compelling personal stories to convey a direct path to success. Those that skip this manuscript do so at their own peril. The competitive advantage this book provides makes it intellectual bedrock for future generations of cybersecurity leadership.”<br>Jay Leek<br> Managing Partner and Co-founder of SYN Ventures Board Director and former CISO <br>“One of the biggest blind spots for many CISOs today is understanding security"s role in the broader business framework of their company. Matt Sharp and Rock Lambros are experienced CISOs who walk the walk and have laid out very clearly how CISOs can become more influential in their company by understanding the fundamental executive leadership skills necessary for success. “This book should have a place on every CISO’s bookshelf.” <br>?Mark Weatherford<br> Chief Security Officer at the National Cybersecurity Center and former Deputy Undersecretary for Cybersecurity at the U.S. Department of Homeland Security <br>“The array of technical disciplines in security makes it endlessly complex. This reality can be overwhelming for the new CISO taking focus away from the business and its pursuit of opportunity. The CISO Evolution aims to solve that. It’s the mini-MBA we all need ? but likely never had. I am honored to endorse Matt and Rock’s goals for the new (and not so new) CISO. They aim to give CISOs the tools we need so we can rightly take a seat at the executive (business) table.” <br>?Richard Seiersen<br> CISO; author of<br> The Metrics Manifesto and How To Measure Anything In Cybersecurity Risk<br> <br><br><br>【発送方法】<br>こちらの商品はご注文後に海外からお取り寄せいたしますので、お届けまでに2週間から4週間程度のお時間をいただいております。最大で1か月ほどかかる場合がございますので、お急ぎの方はご購入をお控えいただけますようお願いいたします。ご注文後、弊社の国内配送センターへ取り寄せ、検品・再梱包を行い、「レターパック」または「クリックポスト」にてお客様へ発送いたします。<br><br>【キャンセル商品】<br>ご注文後はリアルタイムで海外へ発注が行われますため、原則としてキャンセルはお受けできません。ご注文の際には十分にご確認の上、お手続きくださいますようお願い申し上げます。<br><br>【在庫切れ・遅延の場合】<br>1か月以上の遅延やメーカーの在庫切れなどが発生した場合には、必ずメールにてご連絡の上、当店からキャンセルさせていただきます。ご注文から1か月を超えても当店からの連絡がないまま放置されることはございませんので、ご安心ください。<br><br>【発送準備中】<br>メーカーから商品を手配中の際は【発送準備中】と表示されます。問題なく商品の手配・発送準備が進んでおりますので、どうぞご安心ください。最大で1か月まで【発送準備中】と表示される場合がございます。<br/><br/><img src="https://item-shopping.c.yimg.jp/i/n/magicdoor_9781119782483_i_20240709070506" />
